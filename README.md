###系统设置

1.Install Dart from https://www.dartlang.org/ (requires Java installed on your system)

2.Install FileZilla from https://filezilla-project.org/ (we'll use this for transferring files)

3.Install Energia (we'll use this with the CC3200)

4.During class .... you'll get sample programs for BeagleBone (in Dart) and CC3200 (in Energia)

**Dart启动**

- For the class, we'll run Dart on the BeagleBone as well as on a laptop you bring.
- Dart uses symlinks, and commonly Linux or Mac are recommended platforms.
- Dart should work fine on modern Windows but is not supported on Windows XP.
- If you can download Dart and run this simple program, your machine is ready to go

		void main() { // The app starts executing here.
		  	print("Hello, IoT IAP @ MIT");   // print a simple test
          }
